# HYDRA
Hydra phishing is a multi-vector cyber attack method where attackers use several fake login pages or malicious channels at once to trick users into entering sensitive info. By rotating domains, IPs, and templates, it makes detection harder and increases the chance of stealing passwords or banking details.
